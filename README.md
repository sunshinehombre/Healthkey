On average, the seasonal influenza directly costs U.S. employers $10+ billion due to hospitalization bills, lost productivity, and related medical treatment. A non-epidemic flu causes more than 200,000 people to be hospitalized. Here at Princeton University, students who are sick suffer from sub-optimal learning experiences and become socially deprived when avoiding others to prevent spreading the disease.

A large number of these cases are attributed to the human hand. Lackadaisical attitudes towards washing hands combined with the habit of eating food during computer use are a recipe for misery.
